Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
Motivate your anger to make them all realize
Climbing the mountain, never coming down
Break into the contents, never falling down

My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve
Sneaking out the classroom by the back door
A man railed at me twice though, but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting, for people like me

Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

You say "Dreams are dreams
I ain't gonna play the fool anymore"
You say "'Cause I've still got my soul"

Take your time baby, your blood needs slowing down
Breach your soul to reach yourself before you gloom
Reflections of fear make shadows of nothing
Shadow of nothing

You still are blind, if you see winding road
'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see

Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry 'cause you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
